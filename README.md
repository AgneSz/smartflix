# Smartflix
Welcome to the Smartflix project! We recommend reading this README thoroughly before you get started.

## How to use this repo

This repo is set up to be integrated with [Techmap](https://graph.techmap.app). As such, there are a few rules about how to use it.

1. Your aim is to complete projects (see the little "Projects" button up above? That one.)
2. Projects are made up of challenges. These challenges each have a **number** (such as `#1 Setup a new Rails application`). You can see them all under the "Issues" button above.
3. To complete projects, you have to complete challenges.
4. To complete a challenge, your should follow the [git branch-and-merge strategy](https://medium.com/swlh/git-branching-and-merging-made-easy-f7dacd4aa75e).

There are five stages to completing an issue:

1. You create a new branch in the format `issueNumber-branchName`. The issue is automatically moved to the "In progress" project column.
2. You use the issue guidance and resources to write beautiful, tested code that solves the issue.
3. You create a pull request for the issue. The issue is automatically moved to the "Review in progress" project column.
4. A reviewer gives you some feedback, and you update your solution. (You don't need to make another pull request; just keep the original one open.)
5. A reviewer approves your solution. The issue is automatically moved to the "Reviewer approved" project column.
6. You merge your pull request into the `main` branch. The issue is automatically moved to the "Done" project column.

> Note that you don't need to wait until the pull request has been merged to move forward. So long as an issue is in the "Review in progress" project column, you can branch from that issue branch and pick up the next ticket.

### Important things before you start

1. You should name your branches in the following format: `issueNumber-branchName`. For instance, `1-setup-a-new-rails-application`. The `branchName` doesn't matter too much. The `issueNumber` matters a lot. It's how we track your progress.
2. Please avoid deleting labels from issues. We use labels for some kinds of tracking. You can add labels if you like!
3. You probably want to do the challenges in the issue number order. In other words, #1 before #2, and so on.
4. Please avoid moving project cards manually around in projects. It actually won't have any effect, and we'd like to save you the disappointment.

### I noticed a bug!
